ðŸ”¥
Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this ðŸ˜Ž
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last

[Chorus]
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night ðŸ¥¶
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
